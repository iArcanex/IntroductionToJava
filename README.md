# Introduction To Java
This repository contains the source code of the projects done for my Introduction to Java course awhile back. 

## What?
Some of these projects are related to exercises and examples from:

***An Introduction to Programming with Java Applets
Elizabeth S. Boese***

However, these are not fully representative of the full solutions required.

Remember... Code to Learn!

## DISCLAIMER:
**These are by no means the most optimal nor efficient renditions of these projects. You may use and adjust them as you see fit, but do not attempt to plagiarize to get an easy A. Clever instructors use class specific templates for projects and will be able to tell the different "accents," (yesâ–¬accents) a programmer will have compared to another. Use these to learn, adapt, and develop your code. If you must use some of this code, cite it, as that would not be counted as plagiarism. Keep in mind, not doing the full course work assigned to you will likely not yield a full score. Happy programming!**
